* Install Git as described in the [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git Pro Git book].
* Install [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] if you don't have it as this project is a Maven based project.

=== Compile and Run Project ===

Open your console / terminal window and clone the repository with

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/ova2/primefaces-cookbook.git

You can now explore the source code with samples, compile and run the project. To install the project, go to the project root folder <tt>primefaces-cookbook</tt> and type the following command

<code>

The demo web application is prepared to run with Jetty 8 server. To run it with JSF Mojarra implementation, type in the console / terminal window

<code>
